Use of Generative AI Tools in the Project
During the development of our machine learning project on electricity price prediction for Habo Plast, I used generative AI tools in a limited and strategic manner. I primarily used Claude by Anthropic to get guidance on implementing the machine learning models and structuring the code.
Specifically, I used the AI tool to:

Get suggestions on how to structure our code for the three different prediction models (Ridge regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network)
Troubleshoot errors in our code implementation, particularly when dealing with data preprocessing and model training issues
Generate basic templates for our documentation files like README.md and user manual
Get explanations of technical concepts related to time series forecasting and evaluation metrics when I wasn't clear about them
Help with reformulating, translating, and expanding certain sections of our report to improve clarity and readability
Generate the literature review section by providing information about existing research on electricity price prediction methods and the influence of weather variables

I was careful to ensure that all factual information about our project implementation and results came from our own work and analysis. For instance, I didn't use AI to interpret our model results or draw conclusions about which model performed best for our specific problem. All performance metrics, graphs, and analytical conclusions were derived from our actual implementation and evaluation.
I also made sure to review all AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance to our specific project context. In several cases, I had to modify suggestions significantly to match our actual data structure and project requirements.
This experience taught me that AI tools can be valuable aids for coding assistance and documentation templates, but they need to be used with critical oversight. They were most helpful for general structure and syntax issues, but our domain-specific knowledge about the electricity price prediction problem and our specific dataset was essential for creating a meaningful implementation.
