## Week 1 (date: 05/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I took responsibility for setting up the project infrastructure, including creating the Git repository, organizing files, and defining coding standards.
I also started exploring validation techniques for time series, which differ from traditional cross-validation methods.

### What I learned/my thoughts
I learned the importance of good organization from the beginning of a data science project.
Validating time series models presents specific challenges, especially the need to respect the chronological order of data to avoid information leaks.
I also thought about how evaluation metrics should be adapted to the context of price prediction.

### Plan for next week
- Finalize the project structure and validation procedures
- Start working on the unified prediction function
- Explore appropriate evaluation metrics for our problem

## Week 2 (date: 12/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I finalized the project structure and implemented validation procedures respecting the time order of the data.
I worked on developing the main script that orchestrates the entire processing pipeline.
I also started exploring model comparison mechanisms and defining custom metrics relevant to industry.

### What I learned/my thoughts
Setting up a robust pipeline is crucial for ensuring reproducibility of results and making it easier to iterate on models.
I also discovered that, beyond standard statistical metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²), it's important to consider business metrics like the economic cost of prediction errors, which can be asymmetric (underestimating the price may be more costly than overestimating it, or vice versa).

### Plan for next week
- Develop model comparison scripts
- Implement the unified prediction function
- Start working on technical documentation

## Week 3 (date: 19/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I developed model comparison scripts, allowing systematic and fair evaluation of different approaches.
I implemented the unified prediction function that encapsulates the three models and can provide either the best model's prediction or a weighted average.
I also started writing technical documentation and the user manual.

### What I learned/my thoughts
Implementing a unified prediction function made me think about the trade-offs between flexibility and ease of use.
I also learned the importance of rigorous testing to ensure models work correctly in different scenarios.
Model comparison revealed interesting insights about their respective strengths and weaknesses.

### Plan for next week
- Finalize the prediction function and documentation
- Contribute to writing the final report
- Prepare visualizations for the presentation

## Week 4 (date: 26/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I finalized the prediction function and created comprehensive documentation explaining its use.
I contributed to writing the final report, particularly on technical aspects and model comparison results.
I also created interactive visualizations to illustrate the predictions of different models compared to actual values.

### What I learned/my thoughts
This final week allowed me to consolidate my knowledge of the entire process of developing a prediction model.
Creating effective visualizations is crucial for communicating results convincingly.
I also thought about possibilities for future improvement and possible extensions of the project.

### Plan for next week
- Finalize all project deliverables
- Prepare the final presentation
- Consider possible improvements for future work

## Final reflection on the project
This project gave me valuable experience in managing an end-to-end data science project, from data collection and preprocessing to implementing advanced models and presenting results.
I particularly appreciated the interdisciplinary collaboration, combining skills in programming, statistics, and domain knowledge.

Electricity price prediction is a complex problem with many variables at play, and our approach showed that a combination of traditional and advanced techniques can give excellent results.
For future work, I would be interested in integrating additional data such as renewable energy production forecasts and developing a continuous model update system to adapt to market changes.
