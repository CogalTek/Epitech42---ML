# Individual project journal - Electricity price prediction Habo Plast

Name: Loshma Latha Babu
Student number: 20XX202

## Week 1 (date: 05/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I took charge of analyzing the industrial context and specific needs of Habo Plast regarding electricity price prediction.
I researched information about the plastic industry and its energy requirements, as well as how the electricity market works in Sweden.
I also helped define the project goals and develop the work plan.

### What I learned/my thoughts
I discovered that the plastic industry is very sensitive to energy costs, which can represent up to 20% of operating costs.
Sweden, with its price zone system, has a complex electricity market where prices can vary greatly by region and season.
This understanding of the context is essential to develop a truly useful model for Habo Plast.

### Plan for next week
- Analyze the economic implications of prediction errors
- Start exploring relationships between electricity prices and economic variables
- Contribute to defining relevant evaluation metrics

## Week 2 (date: 12/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I analyzed the economic implications of prediction errors for Habo Plast and developed a framework to evaluate the financial impact of different types of errors.
I also started exploring relationships between electricity prices and various economic variables, although we decided to focus mainly on weather variables for this project.
I contributed to defining evaluation metrics, emphasizing their relevance to industry.

### What I learned/my thoughts
The economic analysis revealed that for Habo Plast, underestimating electricity prices can be more costly than overestimating them, as it can lead to non-optimal production decisions.
I also learned that relationships between electricity prices and economic variables are complex and often influenced by government policies and geopolitical factors that are difficult to include in a model.

### Plan for next week
- Start writing the introduction and context of the report
- Contribute to interpreting preliminary model results
- Explore practical implications of predictions for Habo Plast

## Week 3 (date: 19/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I wrote the introduction and context of the report, emphasizing the relevance of the project for Habo Plast and the plastic industry in general.
I also helped interpret preliminary model results, evaluating their practical usefulness for production planning.
I started developing recommendations on how Habo Plast could integrate these predictions into their decision-making processes.

### What I learned/my thoughts
Interpreting model results made me realize the importance of clearly communicating predictions and their uncertainties to decision-makers.
A statistically perfect model can be useless if it's not understandable or usable by the people who need to make decisions based on its predictions.
I also thought about how predictions could be integrated into a larger decision support system.

### Plan for next week
- Finalize practical implications and recommendations
- Contribute to writing the conclusion

## Week 4 (date: 26/02/2025)

### What I did this week
I finalized the section on practical implications and recommendations for Habo Plast, detailing how the company could use the prediction model to optimize its energy consumption.
I also contributed to writing the report conclusion and preparing the final presentation.
I collaborated with the entire team to ensure report consistency and verify that our recommendations are based on solid results.

### What I learned/my thoughts
This final week strengthened my appreciation for the importance of translating technical results into practical and actionable recommendations.
I also learned the importance of clearly and concisely communicating complex results to a non-technical audience.
Looking at the whole project, I was impressed by how relatively simple models can provide valuable information for important business decisions.

### Plan for next week
- Prepare the final project presentation
- Gather feedback on our recommendations
- Consider possibilities for extending the project

## Final reflection on the project
This project was an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a concrete industrial problem with significant economic implications.
I particularly appreciated being able to combine technical aspects (modeling, data analysis) with business considerations (implications for Habo Plast, practical recommendations).

The excellent result of the Ridge model shows that a relatively simple approach can be very effective when applied with a good understanding of the problem and quality data.
For the future, I would be interested in exploring the integration of this model into a larger production optimization system, which could take into account not only electricity prices, but also other factors such as product demand, raw material costs, and capacity constraints.
